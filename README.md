# 2019 California Wildfire Dashboard


## Project Proposal
- Design an interactive JavaScript dashboard webpage containing a leaflet map and summary table for 2019 California Wildfires where the user can filter the data by month,
  as well as a separate page of plotly charts to further summarize the wildfire impact. Dashboard will be initialized with flask application that will store all data into a PostgreSQL database and create an API.
